# Word Recognition
## ML project for School in AI @ UNIMORE

School in AI @ UNIMORE is an intensive coruse on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 

My project consists in recognizing the presence of certain words inside audio tracks. The idea is the same as services like _ok google_ or _ehi siri_: as the machine finds these words in a track, it activates some features.

This is intresting in the domotic field: we can train the network for some activation expression which help you to control the house by speaking, such as "lights on", "lights off", "turn the fan on"...

The possibilities are basically endless. 

The source code is available in `./src` folder, while the documentation to the project is in `./docs`.
